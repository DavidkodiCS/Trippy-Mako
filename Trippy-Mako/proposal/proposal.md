# Capstone Proposal

## 1. Overview

- **What are you planning to build?**
  - Our team will build a Command Line Interface Tool that implements the TURN protocol. This tool will allow users to send and receive data to another computer behind a NAT with a TURN server acting as an intermediary. The actual implementation of the protocol will be given to our customer, Capt Burn, USMC at MARFORCYBER.
  
- **What problem will it solve?**
  - Our product will support MARFORCYBER in their Research and Development needs. Our implementation of the TURN Protocol with authentication and encryption features will support MARFORCYBER in research that they would not be able to do without our work and commitment to the project. Our Command Line Interface will make it so that our customer can easily use our product solo if they choose to do so.

- **Why is it important?**
  - Our product will directly support current research and development needs of MARFORCYBER. The product that our customer is asking for as well as our research done on the TURN protocol and authentication from client to peer(s) is directly supporting the mission of MARFORCYBER. The need that we are meeting with our product is not a manufactured, but one that is

## 2. Market Research/Lit Review

- **Existing Processes**
  - Our capstone will be delivered to our customer as a CLI tool but our implementation of TURN will be delivered separately for the customer to continue working on it. As of right now our customer will take our tool but it is highly likely that they will use our implementation to add to already existing research.

- **Market Research**
  - The closest solution to this project would be Tailscale, which uses the wireguard protocol. Tailscale is a VPN service that allows any device you own to become accessible anywhere in the world through a secure VPN acting as an intermediary between the two devices. The goal of our capstone is to provide a very similar product that uses TURN Servers as an intermediary.

- **Discovery Insights**
  - The design of our implementation will be based on the TURN protocol and most of our research will be done through the RFCs and similar open source work done. In order to achieve secure authentication we will do research on TLS and Certifications. The final result will simply be a merge of both implementations that should work together seamlessly.

## 3. Proposed Design and Architecture

- **User Types/Personas**
  - Capt Burn is our customer and user. He will use our research and product to add on to his own work at MARFORCYBER. We will be writing our product in Python and focus on networking between Linux machines, which is what our customer asked from us.

- **System Design**
  - Explain how your proposed system will address the identified problem. Describe the core functionalities and how they will work together to solve the problem.

- **System Architecture**
  - Provide a detailed breakdown of the system components, including both software and hardware (if applicable). Consider including diagrams or visual representations of how components interact.

## 4. Project Management

- **Preliminary Release Plan**
  - Offer a rough timeline for development, testing, and deployment. Include significant milestones and the expected timeline for each phase.

- **Product Backlog**
  - List the high-priority features, functionalities, and tasks that need to be completed for the project. Prioritize by order of importance.

- **Risk Mitigation**
  - Identify potential risks that could impede the projectâ€™s success. For each risk, propose possible mitigation strategies. Capture these as stories (user stories, task stories, etc.).

- **Key Faculty Involvement**
  - Networking: LCDR Downs
  - Authentication: Professor Brown
  - General Development: Capt Burn

## 5. Admin/Fine Print

- **GFI/GFE (Government-Furnished Information/Equipment)**
  - None

- **Customer Meeting Requirements/Plan**
  - Outline a meeting schedule or plan for engaging with your customer during development. Highlight key touchpoints for feedback.

- **Acceptance Window**
  - The final version of our Capstone project will be complete by April.

- **Code Delivery**
  - The final version of our Capstone project will be delivered to our customer through our repository. Capt Burn is a member of our GitHub repository so he is constantly aware of our progress.

- **Usage License**
  - The software developed as part of the capstone course becomes
property of the DoD. The Computer Science Department does not assume any
responsibility for maintaining the software produced for any customer of the capstone
project. The customer may use the software within the context of their USNA affiliation,
and may not distribute it without approval from the USNA legal office.

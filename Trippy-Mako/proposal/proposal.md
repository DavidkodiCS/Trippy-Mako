# Capstone Proposal

## 1. Overview

- **What are you planning to build?**
  - Our team will build a Command Line Interface Tool that implements the TURN protocol. This tool will allow users to send and receive data to another computer behind a NAT with a TURN server acting as an intermediary. The actual implementation of the protocol will be given to our customer, Capt Burn, USMC at MARFORCYBER.
  
- **What problem will it solve?**
  - Our product will support MARFORCYBER in their Research and Development needs. Our implementation of the TURN Protocol with authentication and encryption features will support MARFORCYBER in research that they would not be able to do without our work and commitment to the project. Our Command Line Interface will make it so that our customer can easily use our product solo if they choose to do so.

- **Why is it important?**
  - Our product will directly support current research and development needs of MARFORCYBER. The product that our customer is asking for as well as our research done on the TURN protocol and authentication from client to peer(s) is directly supporting the mission of MARFORCYBER. This tool is made to ameliorate a deficicency in utilities that supports the larger MARFORCE cyber mission.

## 2. Market Research/Lit Review

- **Existing Processes**
  - Our capstone will be delivered to our customer as a CLI tool but our implementation of TURN will be delivered separately for the customer to continue working on it. As of right now our customer will take our tool but it is highly likely that they will use our implementation to add to already existing research.

- **Market Research**
  - The closest solution to this project would be Tailscale, which uses the wireguard protocol. Tailscale is a VPN service that allows any device you own to become accessible anywhere in the world through a secure VPN acting as an intermediary between the two devices. The goal of our capstone is to provide a very similar product that uses TURN Servers as an intermediary.

- **Discovery Insights**
  - The design of our implementation will be based on the TURN protocol and most of our research will be done through the RFCs and similar open source work done. In order to achieve secure authentication we will do research on TLS and Certifications. The final result will simply be a merge of both implementations that should work together seamlessly. Our CLI tool will be based on tools like Metasploit 

## 3. Proposed Design and Architecture

- **User Types/Personas**
  - Capt Burn is our customer and user. He will use our research and product to add on to his own work at MARFORCYBER. We will be writing our product in Python and focus on networking between Linux machines, which is what our customer asked from us.

- **System Design**
  - Our implementation of the TURN protocol and authentication method will work together seamlessly. From the user's point of view the CLI Tool will be simple and easy to use. Configuration will be akin to configuring an exploit in Metasploit, for example.

- **System Architecture**
  - See OV-1 for an example of the system architecture. No hardware is needed for this capstone as everything will be virtualized.

# Capstone Proposal

## 1. Overview

- **What are you planning to build?**
  - Our team will build a Command Line Interface Tool that implements the TURN protocol. This tool will allow users to send and receive data to another computer behind a NAT using a TURN server. The actual implementation of the protocol will be given to our customer, Capt Burn, USMC at MARFORCYBER.
  
- **What problem will it solve?**
  - Our product will support the needs of our customer.

- **Why is it important?**
  - Our product will support the needs of our customer.

## 2. Market Research/Lit Review

- **Existing Processes**
  - Our capstone will either be its own entity or our implementation of TURN with added features important to our customer will be added to an already existing tool.

- **Market Research**
  - The closest solution to this project would be Tailscale, which uses the wireguard protocol. Tailscale is a VPN service that allows any device you own to become accessible anywhere in the world through a secure VPN acting as an intermediary between the two devices. The goal of our capstone is to provide a very similar product that uses TURN Servers as an intermediary, which is needed by our customer. 

- **Discovery Insights**
  - Share any relevant findings from the discovery phase that informed your design choices.

## 3. Proposed Design and Architecture

- **User Types/Personas**
  - Identify and describe each type of user who will interact with the system. Include key characteristics and needs of each user type.

- **System Design**
  - Explain how your proposed system will address the identified problem. Describe the core functionalities and how they will work together to solve the problem.

- **System Architecture**
  - Provide a detailed breakdown of the system components, including both software and hardware (if applicable). Consider including diagrams or visual representations of how components interact.

## 4. Project Management

- **Preliminary Release Plan**
  - Offer a rough timeline for development, testing, and deployment. Include significant milestones and the expected timeline for each phase.

- **Product Backlog**
  - List the high-priority features, functionalities, and tasks that need to be completed for the project. Prioritize by order of importance.

- **Risk Mitigation**
  - Identify potential risks that could impede the projectâ€™s success. For each risk, propose possible mitigation strategies. Capture these as stories (user stories, task stories, etc.).

- **Key Faculty Involvement**
  - List faculty members who are knowledgeable about the topic and who may be able to provide advice or guidance.

## 5. Admin/Fine Print

- **GFI/GFE (Government-Furnished Information/Equipment)**
  - Detail any resources you need, such as government-provided equipment, information, or datasets.

- **Customer Meeting Requirements/Plan**
  - Outline a meeting schedule or plan for engaging with your customer during development. Highlight key touchpoints for feedback.

- **Acceptance Window**
  - Specify the time frame within which your system or project will be delivered to the customer for final review and acceptance.

- **Code Delivery**
  - Describe how and where the final code will be delivered (e.g., through a repository, directly to a customer, etc.).

- **Usage License**
  - The software developed as part of the capstone course becomes
property of the DoD. The Computer Science Department does not assume any
responsibility for maintaining the software produced for any customer of the capstone
project. The customer may use the software within the context of their USNA affiliation,
and may not distribute it without approval from the USNA legal office.

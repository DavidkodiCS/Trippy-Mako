## Project Summary

**Project Name**: TURN Protocol CLI Tool for MARFORCYBER  
**Classification**: Unclassified

### Overview

This project focuses on developing a CLI tool for the TURN protocol with the potential integration of additional features to streamline and enhance its functionality.

### Project Steps

1. **Implement the TURN Protocol**
   - Language: To be determined (potentially Python)
   - Reference Source: [Lync Edge STUN/TURN Guide](https://blog.schertz.name/2012/10/lync-edge-stun-turn/)

2. **Begin Development of the CLI**
   - Focus on making the tool simple and streamlined for user interaction.

3. **Integrate Unclassified Features**
   - Authentication mechanisms.
   - Control over the size of data transfer.
   - Indication of completion for data sends.
   - Capability to use multiple TURN servers for routing to a destination.

## Classified Work

- A classified write-up on all features of the tool.
- A potential use-case scenario analysis.
- **Annex**: Discussion of ways to preserve the project (consult with Capt Burn).

**Note**: Certain features of the project may require a classified designation.

**Deliverables**:

- Classified paper detailing the project scope, methods, and findings.

## Brainstorming Session 1

### Key Ideas

- **Explore the Wireguard Protocol**: 
  - Unlike TURN servers, this protocol uses VPN servers as intermediaries.
  - **Potential Action**: Add this as another feature of the tool.

- **Functionality to Push and Pull Data**:
  - Consider encryption of data.
  - Determine appropriate data structures for writing files.

- **CLI Tool Options**:
  - Develop a more complex version for advanced users.
  - Ensure the CLI can be set up easily, similar to metasploit.

- **Documentation**:
  - Include man pages and thorough documentation for ease of use.

- **Essential Features for a Good Tool**:
  - What core features should always be present in such a tool?

# Daily Scrum JAN25

This should be a relatively short document

This will be filled out by us when we meet in person or over Google Meet. Basically it will just list all four of us and then have the scrum questions listed under our names so we can fill them in. I put an example below:

## Charlie

1. What have you done since last meeting?
Finally got tests to be portable (huge win) in the process of writing a test to ensure the server is running.
2. What will you accomplish today / until the next daily scrum?
Write test to verify server is running! Try to make headway on docker mounted volumes. Add license stuff.
3. What impediments or obstacles are in your way?
Need to catch up with Downs about Docker configurations thing.
4. What is your confidence on a scale of 1 to 10 that you will accomplish what you want to do.

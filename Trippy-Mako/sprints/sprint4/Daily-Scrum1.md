# Daily Scrum JAN25

This should be a relatively short document

This will be filled out by us when we meet in person or over Google Meet. Basically it will just list all four of us and then have the scrum questions listed under our names so we can fill them in. I put an example below:

## Charlie

1. What have you done since last meeting?
2. What will you accomplish today / until the next daily scrum?
3. What impediments or obstacles are in your way?
4. What is your confidence on a scale of 1 to 10 that you will accomplish what you want to do.

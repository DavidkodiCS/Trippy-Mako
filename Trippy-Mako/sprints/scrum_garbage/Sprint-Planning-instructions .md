# This is what we should start with each week

## Features to be accomplished during this sprint

All of us will meet and look at the features Dave is planning in the product backlog.*Note that the product backlog will have ALL of the features we are planning for the entire capstone*. These should be super high level. During this meeting Meris and Charlie will ask Dave questions about the features and get an idea of which ones we can accomplish during this sprint

1. Feature 1

2. Feature 2

## Task Breakdown (Sprint Backlog)

Once all of the features are laid out we need to decompose the features together and think about what tasks need to be accomplished for each feature. All of these tasks will be added to a **Sprint Backlog**. *Note that the sprint backlog is different from the product backlog as there is only a couple features included and a lot of tasks*

In terms of tasks there basically should be three types of tasks. I have listed them in the order that they should be done.

1. Testing tasks: Think of this like making a submit system for this feature. When we write our coding tasks (described below) we know they're done if we can pass all of the tests made. There should be one testing task for each coding task we have.
2. Coding tasks: These tasks will concern the actual code that will ultimately run when we run the CLI. There basically should be an equal number of coding and testing tasks. If it seems like it will be trivial to write a testing task for a coding task then that coding task is too small. If you can't imagine how to write a test for a coding task then that coding task should decomposed.
3. Scrum tasks: These tasks will be the most annoying to get done but we need to do them and LIH. This includes but is not limited to things like scheduling a meeting with the customer, the customer meeting itself, the sprint planning meeting, preparing the class presentation, etc.
4. **Bonus** Documentation tasks: Basically the opposite of testing tasks where after a coding and testing task is completed we write documentation for anything we created.

### Sprint backlog for feature one selected during this sprint

I would put a md table here where we have five cols:

1. Task: a smaller task as a part of this feature that we came up with during this meeting
2. Est Hours:  the number of hours we think this task will take
3. Actual Hours: Will be blank during this meeting and filled in later by whomever was assigned this task
4. Assigned: Basically we will just pick up tasks as we go through the sprint hungry hungry hippos style. To begin we should basically all be looking at some kind of testing task and once you finish that you basically unlock the opportunity to do the coding task for that test or make another test. Alternatively if you see a testing task with no coding task done you can do the coding task for that test. Optimally in my mind everyone will try to do coding tasks for tests that they did not write.
5. Status: Blank at the time of this meeting, will be filled out by the person assigned the task.

### Sprint backlog for feature two selected during this sprint

Same md table as above here!

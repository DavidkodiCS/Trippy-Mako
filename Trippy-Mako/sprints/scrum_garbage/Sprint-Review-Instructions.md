# This document will be used when we meet with the customer

## Before meet

Ironically in the document all about meeting with the customer the first section is all about what we need to do before meeting with the customer

1. Calculate our Velocity: I think this could best be done in just paragraph form as everything in the release plan like story points is very ambiguous. Downs seems to care a lot about seeing how many hours we're doing so for now our best bet is to keep the sprint plan/burndown chart/tasks list (all the same thing) up to date with hours and tasks and then we can figure out feature stuff from there.
2. Update the release plan: In the beginning we will have a lot of restructuring to do but as things go this will be easier. For this we just need to go into the updated release plan document in Trippy-Mako/meetings/release_plan.md and check off features or add new ones where they're needed.
3. Presentation/Demo: This is the biggest, most concrete pre-meeting task. We need to make sure our customer, and by extension theoretically anyone can pick up our project and immediately get to work without any need for installing or updating anything other than maybe Docker.

## During meeting

If we did the pre-meeting stuff well this should be straightforward. The customer will pull our project and start using it. When they get going we will ask them do navigate and try things and see how it works out.

Once the Demo is over we can go over the release plan and review exactly what was completed and what we're doing next. If the customer is all good with that we're set to start the next sprint planning meeting with that feature.

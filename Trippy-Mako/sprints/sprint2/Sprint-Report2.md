# Sprint 2 Report: CLI Skeleton

## Features developed and demoed during the Sprint Review

### Features Developed and Demoed:

- Testing for basic navigation through CLI and configuration features / .ini file management for configuration features : Francesconi / Larkins

- Core CLI Skeleton and configuration features : Kreidler

## Accepted Features

All feautures for this sprint have been accepted after demo. There are a couple bugs that were found in testing. Fixes for these bugs have been added to the product backlog.


## Stories/features added to the backlog since the last Sprint Review Email

### Core CLI structure basic configuration system:
- Add filesystem for storing TURN configurations
- Add commands for saving and deleting TURN configurations
- Access and modify TURN configurations

### Commands for triggering main features:
- Main Menu features and using menus to navigate tool
- Options available to select config, send, or proxy

### Error handling, user feedback, and help command
- Users that input incorrect commands are asked to try again
- File load errors

## Updates to the Release Plan

 Our original release plan had us starting in late October with sprints that are all a minimum of two weeks. Fortunately when we took the goal and deliverables for this week and broke them down into features with story points, we fit everything into a one week sprint.

 Because we are starting at a new date this sprint contains the goal and features for what was originally listed as sprint 2 in our release plan. This means all dates need to be restructured to fit this sprint and then future sprints starting 6JAN25 when we regroup for the next sprint.

### Updated Member Velocities:

| Member Name   | Predicted Velocity | Updated Velocity |
|---------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Francesconi   | 2                  | 2                |
| Kreidler      | 4                  | 4                |
| Larkins       | 2                  | 2                |


## Velocity Math and how that factors into updated release plan.

Francesconi:
Pair programming with kreidler on implementation of code for accessign and saving configurations to ini fileNothing accomplished this sprint outside of sprint deliverables.


Kreidler:
Started skeleton code and created features for updating and saving configurations. More work is required to fully flesh out deployment, half predicted velocity achieved.


Larkins:
Created tests for features designed this sprint. Velocity achieved!

## Next sprint plan

Next sprint we plan to have an official Sprint Planning meeting to break down the goals "Virtual Box Testing Environment Setup" and creation of the testing VMs for our simulated network architecture. From there we will take our assigned features and build them to be deliverable to the customer for the next Sprint Retrospective.

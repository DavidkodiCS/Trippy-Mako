Since last meeting I have worked on our scrum documentation and preparing us for our next meeting.

I want to start looking into ways to make our project most portable so that it can be used by the customer easily.

Right now I am not sure if it is better to Dockerize the project or use a Python VM.

I will continue to research how to build STUN packets using python's struct module.

None.

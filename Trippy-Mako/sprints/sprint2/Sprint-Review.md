# Sprint Review 15JAN25

## Before meeting tasks

### Calculate our Velocity

Basically will be made up - we still have some catching up to do with what exactly were the features for this sprint.

### Update the release plan

Need to work on this tonight (16JAN25)

### Presentation/Demo

Need to make project shippable - I am going to try and achieve this tonight as a feature.

## During meeting

### Customer Demo Notes

If we did the pre-meeting stuff well this should be straightforward. The customer will pull our project and start using it. When they get going we will ask them do navigate and try things and see how it works out.

### Release plan Features accomplished and next features agreed to

Once the Demo is over we can go over the release plan and review exactly what was completed and what we're doing next. If the customer is all good with that we're set to start the next sprint planning meeting with that feature.

# Sprint Review 15JAN25

## Before meeting tasks

1. Calculate our Velocity:

2. Update the release plan:

3. Presentation/Demo: 


## During meeting

If we did the pre-meeting stuff well this should be straightforward. The customer will pull our project and start using it. When they get going we will ask them do navigate and try things and see how it works out.

Once the Demo is over we can go over the release plan and review exactly what was completed and what we're doing next. If the customer is all good with that we're set to start the next sprint planning meeting with that feature.

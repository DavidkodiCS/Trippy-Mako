# Sprint Review 30JAN25

## Before meeting tasks

### Calculate our Velocity

After this third sprint we were able to once again complete each feature to about 95% completion. The last 5% that is not done I would leave for bugs that we have not encountered yet or that our customer encountered in demoing. As a team, we have the capability to move faster, but this could result in having to fix more bugs in the back end. 

### Update the release plan

[Release Plan](Trippy-Mako\sprints\updatedReleasePlan.md)

### Presentation/Demo

Our customer was able to demo our product on his home workstation through a published docker image.

## During meeting

### Customer Demo Notes

The demo went a lot better this time because our customer was able to test it himself and use our demo feature. We were able to get a lot better feedback during this meeting and were able to give our customer a lot better of an idea of where we are going with the capstone after the demo and talking about our next couple of sprints.

### Release plan Features accomplished and next features agreed to

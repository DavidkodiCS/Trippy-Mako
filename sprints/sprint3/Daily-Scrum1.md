# Daily Scrum JAN25

This should be a relatively short document

This will be filled out by us when we meet in person or over Google Meet. Basically it will just list all four of us and then have the scrum questions listed under our names so we can fill them in. I put an example below:

## Charlie

1. What have you done since last meeting?
Working on tests for cli and a custom test that can be updated based on different commands input. Trying to get
tests to be portable as well as making configs.ini persistent between images.
2. What will you accomplish today / until the next daily scrum?
I am going to try and not fail today. Docker is making me sad.
3. What impediments or obstacles are in your way?
I can't figure out why docker doesn't generate files in the correct places or removes directories entierly.
4. What is your confidence on a scale of 1 to 10 that you will accomplish what you want to do.

## David

1. What have you done since last meeting?

Since the last meeting I completed all the code for sprint 2. The entire configuration feature is complete minus some minor error handling. Most tasks in feature one is in progress and near completion.

2. What will you accomplish today / until the next daily scrum?

Today I will finish the CoTurn documentation for developers, work on building more packets, and revamp the release plan.

4. What impediments or obstacles are in your way?

None.

5. What is your confidence on a scale of 1 to 10 that you will accomplish what you want to do.

8. This sprint is significantly larger and more challenging than the last sprint but we have a better formula for scrumming down which should make everything else move faster.

## Meris

1. What have you done since last meeting?
   - I created a testing framework for our project.
3. What will you accomplish today / until the next daily scrum?
   - I will continue writing tests as more features are outlined.
5. What impediments or obstacles are in your way?
   - none
7. What is your confidence on a scale of 1 to 10 that you will accomplish what you want to do.

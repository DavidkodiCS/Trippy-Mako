# Sprint 3 Report

## Features developed and demoed during the Sprint Review

### Features Developed and Demoed:

- Feature 1: As a dev I can run a turn server to test sending packets & receiving server information

- Feature 2: As a user I can select a DEMO option & send an allocate packet to the TURN server and see a plaintext response from the server

- Feature 3: VM/Test Environment R&D + As a dev  I can spin up a VM test architecture with TURN server & 2 Clients

## Accepted Features

All feautures for this sprint have been accepted after demo. Our customer was able to demo our product on his workstation at home through a published docker image. Research and Development progress on feature three was discussed with our customer. This third feature will continue into the next sprint and be used for testing as we progress in the capstone.

## Stories/features added to the backlog since the last Sprint Review Email

### See next Sprint Plan

## Updates to the Release Plan

 Sprint 4, 5, 6 features have been planned, but we will still hold sprint planning meetings to break out individual tasks.

## Updated Member Velocities:

All members have been able to keep up with sprint demands for the last two sprints. In this last sprint David was not able to fully flesh out reading server response but more time can be allocated towards that task if needed and applicable to future features. As a team we need to work a little faster so for the next sprint we are looking to complete most tasks and the next sprint planning meeting by Sunday, FEB 9.


## Velocity Math and how that factors into updated release plan.

Based on our current team velocity we are on track to finish the features that we planed out in sprints 5 and 6.

## [Next sprint plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iDczfXFm2CANtSYXumhWK-F_ozv4bLBBos8dFoWCZYU/edit?gid=972462669#gid=972462669)

Next sprint we plan on building on our progress of communicating between the client and adding the feature of being able to do this behind a private network. By the end of this sprint our testing architecture to create a more realistic scenario for our client should be nearly finished.

# Daily Scrum JAN25

This should be a relatively short document

This will be filled out by us when we meet in person or over Google Meet. Basically it will just list all four of us and then have the scrum questions listed under our names so we can fill them in. I put an example below:

## Charlie

Worked on the poster and started doing some testing work
2. What will you accomplish today / until the next daily scrum?
Trying to get poster rounded out and presentation
3. What impediments or obstacles are in your way?

# Sprint 4/5 Report

## Features developed and demoed during the Sprint Review

### Features Developed and Demoed:

1. As a user I can demo communicating back and forth between two hosts and TURN server on the same LAN.

2. As a user I can send Allocation and Refresh packets to the TURN server from a private network (behind a NAT).

3. R&D: Testing architecture Pt.2

## Accepted Features

All feautures for this sprint have been accepted after demo. Our customer was able to demo our product on his workstation at home through a published docker image. Research and Development progress on feature three was discussed with our customer. This third feature will continue into the next sprint and be used for testing as we progress in the capstone.

## [Next sprint plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iDczfXFm2CANtSYXumhWK-F_ozv4bLBBos8dFoWCZYU/edit?gid=972462669#gid=972462669)

Next sprint we plan on building on our progress of communicating between the client and adding the feature of being able to do this behind a private network. By the end of this sprint our testing architecture to create a more realistic scenario for our client should be nearly finished.

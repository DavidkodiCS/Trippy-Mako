# Team Charter: David Kreidler, Meris Larkins, and Charlie Francesconi

## 1. Individual Commitment

- **Expectations**: It is expected that each team member puts in 100% effort into their individual tasks and participation in team scrums.
- **Responsibility**: Each team member is responsible for their own work and contributing equally to the project.
- **Communication**: Everyone must actively communicate progress, challenges, and concerns with the team. This includes actively participating in using the scrum board to move tasks to "in progress" and "complete".

## 2. Missed Deadlines

- **Notification**: Team members will notify the team in advance if a certain task is taking longer than expected. At weekly scrums they should say what their confidence level of their task progress is.
- **Contingency Plan**: If a deadline is missed, the team will redistribute the work or adjust the timeline to ensure the project stays on track.

## 3. Unacceptable Work/Performance

### How will your team deal with an underperforming teammate?

- **Feedback**: We will provide constructive feedback to each other, focusing on specific issues and areas for improvement.
- **Support**: We will help each other when needed to ensure that tasks get completed.
- **Accountability**: We will keep each other accountable to complete our tasks.

## 4. Other Concerns

- **Conflicts**: Any conflicts will be addressed in meetings or through our google chat space.
- **Equity**: We will be able to choose what tasks we want to work on using the scrum board idea to make the workload fair and equal.
- **Adaptability**: The team will be flexible in responding to unexpected challenges, adjusting plans as needed to maintain progress and quality.
